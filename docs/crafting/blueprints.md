## Obtaining

- Blueprints can be gathered in a few different ways:
    - by completing **boss fights** (the stronger the boss, the better the loot).
    - by **buying** them (could be a shop that resets daily where you could buy or lend blueprints, lending them will
      allow you to craft the blueprint a certain amount of time for a higher cost before the blueprint disappears)

## Usage

- Blueprints can be **used to craft** [tools](tools.md) or [saddles](saddles.md) of **higher qualities**.
- Quality determines the efficiency and durability of tools and the armor of saddles.
