## Occurrence

### Harvestable resources

- Resource nodes **spawn across the map**
- Certain resources spawn in **certain areas**:
    - trees spawn more often in forests
    - metal spawns more in caves
    - stone spawns more around rocky areas (e.g. around cave entrances, mountains and in areas with no nearby water)

### Lootable resources

- Other resources can only be obtained through **looting**. This could be after defeating a boss

## Obtaining

- Nodes can be **harvested**.
- Harvesting using [tools](crafting/tools.md) or [dinos](dinos/dinos.md) increases the harvesting speed and efficiency.
