# Idle Ark

**Disclaimer:** This game idea is mostly generated by AI so it will be changed in the future. However, it gives a rough idea of the game mechanics and flow of the game.  
**Game Type:** Idle / Incremental Game  
**Inspiration:** Based on ARK: Survival Evolved

Idle Ark is an incremental idle game where players gather resources, unlock new tools, tame dinosaurs, and
gather blueprints to build and survive in a prehistoric world. Players will level up, increase efficiency, and manage
their progression strategy as they unlock and enhance their tools and dinosaurs for maximum resource generation and
combat effectiveness.

## Game Core Mechanics

The game focuses on resource management, efficiency upgrades, and strategy as players slowly build up their base, tools,
and dinosaur companions. Progression revolves around gathering materials, upgrading tools, and taming dinosaurs,
creating a satisfying loop of gradual improvement.

### Key Gameplay Components

1. **Resource Farming**  
   Players collect various resources essential for crafting tools, building structures, and taming dinosaurs. Resources
   are farmed using tools and later aided by dinosaurs, which will be unlocked and leveled up over time.

    - **Core Resources:** Wood, Stone, Metal, Fiber, Hide, Meat, Berries, Thatch, Flint
    - **Advanced Resources:** Oil, Crystal, Obsidian, Cementing Paste, Polymer, Electronics, Element

2. **Tools and Equipment**  
   Starting with only basic tools (or even gathering by hand), players will level up to unlock new, more efficient tools
   that improve resource gathering rates.

    - **Basic Tools:** Players start with their hands and can gather minimal resources.
    - **Unlockable Tools:** Pickaxe, Hatchet, Sickle, Chainsaw, Mining Drill
    - **Blueprint Tools:** Players can acquire blueprints to craft even better versions of each tool, which provide
      higher efficiency but are more expensive to craft.

3. **Experience and Leveling System**  
   Players gain experience by farming resources and leveling up their character, unlocking new tools, equipment, and
   eventually dinosaurs. The leveling system will provide a steady sense of progress and open up more options and
   strategies as players advance.

    - **Leveling Rewards:** Each level grants access to either new tools, dino companions, or additional efficiency
      upgrades.
    - **Milestone Unlocks:** At key levels, players unlock new resources, more advanced tools, or powerful dinosaurs.

4. **Blueprints for Enhanced Tools and Equipment**  
   Players can gather blueprints, which enable the crafting of enhanced versions of tools and equipment. Blueprints
   provide significant efficiency boosts, encouraging players to collect and craft as many as possible.

    - **Blueprints Unlocking:** Blueprints could be found in random events or unlocked as rewards for certain
      achievements.
    - **Crafting Blueprints:** Crafting items from blueprints will cost significantly more resources but will be worth
      it for the increase in farming efficiency.

5. **Dinosaur Taming**  
   Dinosaurs serve as allies in farming resources and eventually in fighting off threats. Each dinosaur specializes in
   gathering specific resources and can be upgraded to perform better in its specialized task.

    - **Resource Gathering Dinosaurs:** Dinosaurs like the Ankylosaurus are better at gathering Metal, while a
      Therizinosaurus excels at gathering Fiber.
    - **Combat Dinosaurs:** Tamed dinosaurs can also be used for defense or assigned to specific roles for combat
      encounters (details on combat below).

6. **Combat System (Optional Feature)**  
   Although exploration is minimized, players can encounter occasional "encounter events" where hostile creatures or
   rival dinosaurs threaten their progress.

    - **Dinosaur Combat Tactics:** Assign certain dinosaurs to defend resources or fend off rivals.
    - **Encounter Events:** Random events could allow players to use combat-ready dinosaurs to earn rewards, like rare
      blueprints or experience boosts, while adding a strategic element to dino training.

### Detailed Progression Flow

#### 1. **Early Game**

- **Gathering Basics:** Players start by gathering resources by hand, which is slow but crucial.
- **Unlocking Basic Tools:** As players level up, they unlock the Pickaxe and Hatchet, which make gathering more
  efficient.
- **Unlocking First Dinosaurs:** Around level 5, players can start taming their first dinosaurs, such as Dodos (for meat
  and eggs) and Trikes (for berries and thatch).
- **First Blueprints:** Basic blueprints are introduced, allowing players to craft slightly upgraded versions of
  Pickaxes and Hatchets.

#### 2. **Mid-Game**

- **Advanced Tools:** By level 10-15, players unlock tools like the Chainsaw and Sickle for faster gathering of wood and
  fiber.
- **Higher Tier Resources:** Resources like Oil and Crystal become available and are farmed at specific "extraction
  sites," which are automated but can be upgraded with better tools and specific dinosaurs.
- **Blueprint Collection:** Blueprints for enhanced tools and dinosaur saddles start to become available, creating
  opportunities for faster and more efficient resource gathering.
- **Specialized Dinosaurs:** Players can tame specialized dinosaurs, like the Ankylosaurus for metal or the Doedicurus
  for stone.

#### 3. **Late Game**

- **Mining Drill and Element Gathering:** Unlocking high-end tools like the Mining Drill allows players to gather rare
  resources, such as Element.
- **Epic Blueprints:** Rare, epic blueprints for high-end equipment can be acquired, offering massive boosts to resource
  production.
- **Combat-Focused Dinosaurs:** Players unlock powerful dinosaurs, like the Rex or Spinosaurus, and can engage in
  challenging encounters.
- **Automated Gatherers:** By level 30+, players can fully automate some resource gathering through advanced dinosaurs
  or tools, creating a passive resource flow.

### Additional Game Features

#### Events and Encounters

- **Blueprint Drops:** Rare events could reward players with special blueprints, keeping the gameplay exciting and
  offering unique opportunities for crafting.
- **Timed Challenges:** Daily or weekly challenges (such as gathering a certain amount of resources) can reward extra
  experience, rare resources, or blueprints.

#### Idle Mode Progression

- **Passive Resource Generation:** Players continue to gather resources while offline, with production rates based on
  their highest level tools, dinosaurs, and blueprints.
- **Energy/Resource Boosts on Login:** Give returning players a burst of resources to boost active playtime when they
  log in, encouraging consistent engagement.

#### Prestige System (Late Game)

- **Rebirth Mechanic:** Upon reaching a certain level, players can "Prestige," resetting some progress but earning
  permanent boosts (e.g., faster experience, higher resource yield).
- **Prestige Rewards:** As players Prestige, they could unlock exclusive blueprints, unique dinosaur types, and
  additional skill bonuses.

   and blueprints.
6. **Idle Progression and Prestige:** Passive resource generation while offline, with the option to Prestige for
   permanent upgrades and endgame content.

### Balancing and Scope Control

To keep the game manageable:

- **No Open World Exploration:** All gathering is handled through the interface without the need for a full 3D world.
  Extraction sites and events are represented through menus or simple visuals.
- **Automation Over Exploration:** Focus on gathering, upgrading, and automating resource collection rather than on
  physical exploration.
- **Simplified Combat System:** Combat encounters are limited to menu-based or turn-based events with selectable
  strategies.
- **Streamlined Prestige System:** Keep late-game progression rewarding but straightforward, allowing players to reset
  for permanent gains without overly complex branching paths.

With a clear progression system, ARK: Idle Evolution can deliver an engaging, rewarding experience inspired by ARK's
survival elements, designed for a lighter, idle game audience.
